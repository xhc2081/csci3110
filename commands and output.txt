For title file, result files and source code, please refer to attachment. (I printed it below, I didnâ€™t print the test file, its waste space)I manually made a list of 20 items which cover 10 singers, 5 soccer players and 5 medicines. After getting results from web service, I parse the result and put them in a list of tuples. By applying the above algorithm, the output of program is:[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15]The array means the labels w.r.t titles. As we can see the first 10 all clustered to label 0, which means it correctly find that those titles are in the same group. The same as all label 10 (soccer player) and label 15 (medicine)
