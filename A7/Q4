Q4
Two problems without Optimal Substructure
1. Longest Path Problem

	




	Goal of the Problem: Find the longest path between two vertices without repeating an edge.
	LongestPath(A,C)
	solution: (A-E-D-C)






	If Principle of Optimality applies to Longest Path Problem:
	Split up the Problem into Optimal Sub Parts
	LongestPath(A,C)
	LongestPath(A,D) + (D-C) Wrong

	The sub solutions do not combine to form the overall optimal solution

	The Longest Path Problem does not exhibit Optimal Substructure

	Not a candidate problem for a Dynamic Programming Solution

2. Maximum Clique Problem




	Definition: Clique - Vertices are all attached to each other.
	Definition: Maximal Clique - A clique with the most vertices in a graph.
	Vertices = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
	Maximal Clique = {5,6,7,8,9}
	Vertices = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} + {8,9}
	cliques = {1,2,3,4},{5,6,7} + {8,9}

	We Cannot break down the set of vertices into smaller sub problems and maintain the overall optimal solution.

	This problem does not exhibit optimal sub structure.

	This problem is not a candidate for a dynamic programming solution.
